# Hi there 👋 I'm Sunkara Rohith

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m an aspiring AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems powered by Machine Learning, Generative AI, and LLM-driven applications.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at The George Washington University, I focus on designing and deploying real-world AI solutions — from multi-output ML models and recommendation systems to LLM-based agents, RAG pipelines, and workflow automation tools.

## 🎓 Education
- **Master's in Computer Science** - George Washington University (2024-Present)
- **Bachelor's in Computer Science** - Gitam University (2019-2023)

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. **Assiduous Study of Hyper-parameters Influence on CNN**
   - **Description**: This research paper investigates the critical role of hyper-parameters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), focusing on how parameters like learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, and filter size impact the network's performance. By conducting a series of experiments with different settings, the study aims to identify the optimal combinations of hyper-parameters that can enhance the training process, reduce overfitting, and improve the accuracy of CNN models.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
   - **Key Learnings**:
     - Gained deep insights into the hyper-parameter optimization process and how these values significantly affect model performance.
     - Experimented with different datasets, adjusting variables such as learning rates and batch sizes to observe how they influence both training time and model accuracy.
     - Focused on finding the balance between underfitting and overfitting by tuning hyper-parameters like dropout rates and network depth.
     - Concluded with practical recommendations for optimal hyper-parameter choices, backed by empirical evidence.

### 2. **Skill-Based Job Recommendation System**
   - **Description**: This project builds an AI-driven job recommendation system that analyzes resumes and suggests relevant job roles while identifying missing skills. It helps users understand which roles match their skill profile and what additional skills are needed to improve their chances.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Streamlit, LangChain, pdfplumber
   - **Key Learnings**:
     - Built a text-based machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF and a linear classifier for job role prediction.
     - Worked with unstructured resume and job posting data, including skill extraction, normalization, and canonicalization.
     - Implemented ranking-based job recommendations and skill gap analysis with human-readable explanations.

### 3. **Ticket Manager (Web 3.0 Application)**
   - **Description**: A decentralized **Web 3.0** application for managing and tracking tickets (support, events, etc.) using blockchain technology. The system allows users to create, update, and track tickets securely through the integration of **Solidity** smart contracts and **MetaMask** for Ethereum-based transactions.
   - **Tech Stack**: React.js, JavaScript, Solidity, MetaMask, Hardhat
   - **Key Learnings**:
     - Developed the front-end interface using **React.js** for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
     - Implemented **Solidity** smart contracts for decentralized ticket management and Ethereum-based transactions.
     - Integrated **MetaMask** for user wallet interaction and transaction management.
     - Used **Hardhat** for smart contract testing, deployment, and Ethereum blockchain integration.

### 4. **Personal Portfolio**
   - **Description**: A personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills in web development and data science. It includes a dynamic layout, clean design, and clear navigation.
   - **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS
   - **Key Learnings**: 
     - Gained hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive web pages.
     - Integrated modern design principles to create an attractive and functional portfolio.

### 5. **Predicting Scores Based on Study Hours**
   - **Task**: The Sparks Foundation GRIP (March 2022)
   - **Description**: This project uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict students' exam scores based on study hours. The model is trained on historical data and evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.
   - **Objective**: Predict scores based on study hours using a supervised learning model.
   - **Key Steps**:
     1. **Data Exploration**: Visualizing the correlation between study hours and scores.
     2. **Model Training**: Fitting a linear regression model using **Scikit-learn**.
     3. **Prediction**: Predicting scores for given study times (e.g., 9.25 hours).
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
