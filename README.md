### 2. **Assiduous Study of Hyper-parameters Influence on CNN**
   - **Description**: This research paper investigates the critical role of hyper-parameters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), focusing on how parameters like learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, and filter size impact the network's performance. By conducting a series of experiments with different settings, the study aims to identify the optimal combinations of hyper-parameters that can enhance the training process, reduce overfitting, and improve the accuracy of CNN models.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
   - **Key Learnings**:
     - Gained deep insights into the hyper-parameter optimization process and how these values significantly affect model performance.
     - Experimented with different datasets, adjusting variables such as learning rates and batch sizes to observe how they influence both training time and model accuracy.
     - Focused on finding the balance between underfitting and overfitting by tuning hyper-parameters like dropout rates and network depth.
     - Concluded with practical recommendations for optimal hyper-parameter choices, backed by empirical evidence.
