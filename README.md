### 2. **Assiduous Study of Hyper-parameters Influence on CNN**
   - **Description**: This research paper investigates the critical role of hyper-parameters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), focusing on how parameters like learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, and filter size impact the network's performance. By conducting a series of experiments with different settings, the study aims to identify the optimal combinations of hyper-parameters that can enhance the training process, reduce overfitting, and improve the accuracy of CNN models.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
   - **Key Learnings**:
     - Gained deep insights into the hyper-parameter optimization process and how these values significantly affect model performance.
     - Experimented with different datasets, adjusting variables such as learning rates and batch sizes to observe how they influence both training time and model accuracy.
     - Focused on finding the balance between underfitting and overfitting by tuning hyper-parameters like dropout rates and network depth.
     - Concluded with practical recommendations for optimal hyper-parameter choices, backed by empirical evidence.

### 4. **Ticket Manager (Web 3.0 Application)**
   - **Description**: A decentralized **Web 3.0** application for managing and tracking tickets (support, events, etc.) using blockchain technology. The system allows users to create, update, and track tickets securely through the integration of **Solidity** smart contracts and **MetaMask** for Ethereum-based transactions.
   - **Tech Stack**: React.js, JavaScript, Solidity, MetaMask, Hardhat
   - **Key Learnings**:
     - Developed the front-end interface using **React.js** for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
     - Implemented **Solidity** smart contracts for decentralized ticket management and Ethereum-based transactions.
     - Integrated **MetaMask** for user wallet interaction and transaction management.
     - Used **Hardhat** for smart contract testing, deployment, and Ethereum blockchain integration.

### 5. **Predicting Scores Based on Study Hours**
   - **Task**: The Sparks Foundation GRIP (March 2022)
   - **Description**: This project uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict students' exam scores based on study hours. The model is trained on historical data and evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared (R¬≤)**.
   - **Objective**: Predict scores based on study hours using a supervised learning model.
   - **Key Steps**:
     1. **Data Exploration**: Visualizing the correlation between study hours and scores.
     2. **Model Training**: Fitting a linear regression model using **Scikit-learn**.
     3. **Prediction**: Predicting scores for given study times (e.g., 9.25 hours).
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
